This folder is used to store the CSV files uploaded by users along with their different versions, it also stores images generated for the reports. The current implementation is impractical and should be enhanced. 

Additionally, there is no function to delete files after a certain period or once a storage limit is reached. 

A better approach would be to implement a database or maybe utilize local storage but im too lazy to make it happen.
